1.We also don't really have pawn shops in Nigeria... i know there are people who 
would prefer to replace some of their shoes with cash. pawnit.africa would 
be a platform that connects all countries on the continent and allow them to
 exchange things across border...

 2.In Ikorodu, most parents that send their children to public schools don't
  have the option of school bus, so they have to rely on bike to take their
   children to school. That can be dangerous and children get kidnapped that 
   way. I could build a small mobile app, schoolbus.io, parents book a slot 
   for their children, and they get picked up every morning and dropped in 
   the afternoon. It is cheaper than normal school bus, it is secure and 
   definitely safer than bikes.
   
   3.At Opic estate, along Ibadan Express, they have water trouble, so they
    have to buy water from truck pushers... the issue is, the water cannot be 
    trusted because most of them don't wash their containers, and no one knows
     where they fetch from. I could build a small mobile (web) app that allows
     them to book water supply for entire month. You promise transparent process, 
     proper water treatment and obviously, might be more expensive than truck 
     pushers, but it's definitely better

     4.Another idea @channel many people die in Africa without telling anyone
      where they have things, how many hidden accounts they have, etc... you 
      could build a "my-will.africa" a virtual will (legally binding), and the
       platform sends a message listing all assets to your people if you don't 
       check in after specified period... Instead of banks, government or some 
       random person taking control of your money

       5.You can also think in terms of connectivity @here connecting apps that
        already exists and making them work together.
