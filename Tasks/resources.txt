It seems a lot of people don't understand the Budget App task. Let me try and break it down
You're to create a class "Budget"
This class will have methods such as deposit, withdraw, transfer, check balance, 
you can also add any other functionalities
For you to use this methods, you have to instantiate this class i.e create a copy of it in memory and
 pass in a category as an argument. In this case, Categories are Food, Clothing etc. (can be anything,)

# How to deploy python project to Heroku
Let get started
Firstly, make sure your project is working on your local machine.
Go to your settings.py file and make sure DEBUG=False
Create a file name Procfile with no extension, make sure its created at the project root level
make sure its not in any app folder or project folder
Copy and paste this into the Procfile
web:gunicorn config.wsgi --log-file -
In my case, config is the name of the folder where my seetings.py is located, name it according to your projectname
save and close
Create a file called runtime.txt
Get the version of python you running on your system with this command
python --version
as for me, mine was 3.9.2. write the below version into runtime.tx and save
python-3.9.2
Create a file and name it requirements.txt at the folder root level
Open your terminal and make sure you are at the root folder level and type
pip freeze > requirements.txt
This command will collect all packages you running on your Django project and save it in requirements.txt
Make sure you already have an account on Heroku or create one
On your terminal type,
heroku login -i
Then press enter
enter your email followed by your password and press enter
Now, we need to install gunicorn by typing the below command to the terminal
pip install gunicorn
Install Django Heroku package with the below command
pip install django-heroku
After installation is completely done. Open your settings.py file
Add this at the top
import django_heroku
Add this at the bottom of the settings.py file
django_heroku.settings(locals())
Note: If the django_heroku.settings is not placed on the last line of the settings file, you will encounter an error.
Let create our Heroku application.
Type in the below command to create the app on your terminal.
heroku create app_name
Example: app_name can be blog-zuri, heroku create blog-zuri
Then copy and paste the below command on the terminal
heroku git:remote -a your_heroku_app_name
Which will be as below for my app
heroku git:remote -a zuri-blog
Let add this app to git
Initialize git with the below command
git init
Add the project to git
git add .
Let commit to git
git commit -m "I just commit my first repo"
Let push to our git remote
git push heroku master
If you encounter any erro then use the command below
git push heroku head:master
Finally, run the below command
heroku run python manage.py migrate
In case you encounter any error
Type the below command
pipenv install
pipenv install django-heroku
git add .
git commit -m "Commit message"
heroku config:set DISABLE_COLLCTSTATIC=1
git push heroku HEAD:master
make sure all this are present in your settings.py file
STATIC_ROOT = os.path.join(BASE_DIR, 'staticfiles')
ALLOWED_HOSTS = ['*']
STATICFILES_DIRS = [BASE_DIR.joinpath('static')]
Note: Git must be install on your system to access git command

On Djanjo rest framework, if you have bandwidth review these videos https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLmDLs7JbXWNjr5vyJhfGu69sowgIUl8z5  and/or download and read Django for APIs book.
